### What I learned

This quiz is a good exercise for me to learn more about HTML,CSS and Javascript. I have some difficulty doing this quiz but i have done as best as i can even though i'm unable to put any javascript here. This quiz has also teach me to be more careful as one mistake can ruin the web


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I will still need to learn more as I'm still not very good at HTML css and javascript, sometime I forgot a lot of syntax and i need to study hard and train more so i can become better at designing a web.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**
